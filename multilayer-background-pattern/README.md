CSS background and background-image stack multiple values onto each other. This is something we'll use to create a multilayered background.

background-size, -repeat, -position can take multiple values as well, first corresponding to the first layer, second to the second, and so on.

linear-gradient and repeating-linear-gradients are used for grids
